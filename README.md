# raw2cdf

Finnigan's RAW to NetCDF converter.

Raw2CDF uses Scientific DataSet library (see [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/scientific-dataset/?from=http{%}3A{%}2F{%}2Fresearch.microsoft.com{%}2Fprojects{%}2Fsds) for more info) and NLog as reference and requires MSFileReader installed to be compiled and work.
